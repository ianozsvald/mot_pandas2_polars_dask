20230523_polars_groupby.ipynb - has query planning diagnostics that we hadn't used, could try these?

PyArrow vs NumPy – which to use? 7
timings from 20230522_pandas_exploration.ipynb - Pandas (arrow+numpy) now slower than before!

Pandas+Arrow, query, Seaborn 8
timings from 20230522_pandas_exploration.ipynb - also slower

Polars – same query & Seaborn 10
20230522_polars_exploration.ipynb - a bit faster

Manual Query Planning 11
20230522_pandas_exploration.ipynb - pandas 2x slower

# 20230520_polars_queries.ipynb
I seemed to be lacking data, the filter didn't give any results now!

# 20230522_polars_exploration.ipynb
'Pandas 2.1.3, Polars 0.19.17'
Runs as before, 
dfple = pl.read_parquet("../test_result_2021on.parquet")
did cost 12GB now costs 22GB but Polars reports 11GB in both cases

df_fuel = df_fuel.with_columns(
    pl.col("first_use_date").dt.year().alias("first_use_year")
).filter((pl.col("fuel_type").is_in({"PE", "DI"})))[
    ["test_mileage", "first_use_year", "fuel_type"]
]
1.5ms not 14ms
but otherwise timings looked similar

# 20230522_pandas_exploration.ipynb

it works but pandas gives some very different results.
